A lightweight BetterDiscord plugin to display in-app notifications that focuses on simplicity and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features

- In-app notifications for mentions, DMs, and in-line replies
- Customizable server-specific notifications
- User and channel blocking capabilities
- Privacy mode for content protection
- Swipe to close notifications
- Hide notifications when you are in Do Not Disturb

## 🔧 Default Operation

Out of the box, PingNotification will be in "Automatic" mode which will alert for all messages that you physically hear a ping for (aka it follows your discord-level notification settings per guild/channel/user.) 

## ⚙️ Configuration

Navigate to `BetterDiscord > Plugins > PingNotification settings` to:
- Customise coloring of user mentions, role mentions and more.
- Customise length of notification shown on screen
- Change display location of the notification window
- Enable 'Privacy Mode' which hides all message content and attachments behind a `hover-to-reveal` system
- Configure the ability to apply 'Privacy Mode' to NSFW channels
- Customise size of the popup
And much more!
