A lightweight BetterDiscord plugin to display in-app notifications that focuses on simplicity and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features

- In-app notifications for all native desktop notifications
- Privacy mode for content protection
- Swipe to close notifications
- Advanced Customization
- Keyword tracking
- Pin / Auto-Pin notifications on AFK
- Read on Close
- And much, much, MUCH more.

## 🔧 Default Operation

Out of the box, PingNotification will alert for all messages that you physically hear a ping for (aka it follows your discord-level notification settings per guild/channel/user.) 

## ⚙️ Configuration

Navigate to `BetterDiscord > Plugins > PingNotification settings` to:
- Customise coloring of user mentions, role mentions and more.
- Customise length of notification shown on screen
- Change display location of the notification window
- Enable 'Privacy Mode' which hides all message content and attachments behind a `hover-to-reveal` system
- Configure the ability to apply 'Privacy Mode' to NSFW channels
- Customise size of the popup
And much more!
